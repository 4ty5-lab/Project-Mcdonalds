This is the hackathon group 67 project.For the machine learning code you need to enter these two commands inside windows CMD:python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm,and pip install numpy spacy scikit-learn,and a  bunch of other commands that will be released probably never.There were no AI tools used,and you can tell it is already very messy.This is a protype only and will be polished probably never.Install a bunch of packages that we will not disclose.HeeHeeHaw.
If you only speak old english:
Hark! This scroll doth pertain to the endeavour of hackathon fellowship, Group Seven and Sixty.

For the cunning art of machine learning, thou must inscribe these conjurations within the Window'd CMD:
`python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
and
`pip install numpy spacy scikit-learn`
...and a host of other sundry commands which, in sooth, shall like never be revealed.

No artificer's tool of AI was employed in this making, and thine own eyes can see the work is most passing strange. 'Tis but a rough-hewn prototype, and shall be burnished to a finer finish... never, most like.

Install a great many packages whose names we shall keep close. HeeHeeHeeHaw.
Note:"Games" are not part of the project but Joshua included them anyways.
